| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Q1           | What is Generative AI and what are its primary use cases across industries?                                                                                                                |
| Q2           | Explain the role of probabilistic modeling in generative models. How do these models differ from discriminative models?                                                                    |
| Q3           | What is the difference between Autoencoders and Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) in the context of text generation?                                                                         |
| Q4           | Describe the working of attention mechanisms in Neural Machine Translation (NMT). Why are they critical?                                                                                   |
| Q5           | What ethical considerations must be addressed when using generative AI for creative content such as poetry or storytelling?                                                                |
| Q6           | Use the given small text dataset to train a simple Variational Autoencoder (VAE) for text reconstruction including preprocessing, model building, training, and reconstruction.            |
| Q7           | Use a pre-trained GPT model (like GPT-2 or GPT-3) to translate a short English paragraph into French and German and provide the original and translated text.                              |
| Q8           | Implement a simple attention-based encoder-decoder model for English-to-Spanish translation using TensorFlow or PyTorch.                                                                   |
| Q9           | Use the provided short poetry dataset to simulate poem generation with a pre-trained GPT model and generate a new 2–4 line poem.                                                           |
| Q10          | Design a creative writing assistant for a publishing company using Generative AI, including model selection, training data, bias mitigation, evaluation methods, and real-world challenges |
